0,"I needed to replace my teens Iphone and absolutely refuse to pay the gross prices of new phones, especially for teens who tend to break or damage phones easier. I almost bought a refurbished phone from Ebay until I saw on Google that Amazon sold them. Amazon has a better return policy and I‚Äôm very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they weren‚Äôt very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and I‚Äôll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front.

2,Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone can‚Äôt expect perfect condition that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone can‚Äôt really see but since I applied a screen protector can‚Äôt see it at all üòÅ. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also can‚Äôt see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but let‚Äôs see how that goes . I‚Äôm not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and it‚Äôs working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyone‚Äôs experience is different.

3,"I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasn‚Äôt expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down.

406,"so when I got this phone the touch screen didn't seem to be working and needed a hard reset to work (hold power button and then tap volume down once then volume up once), after this the phone was good and ran smooth (also had 100% battery health and there were no external flaws on the phone) except the touch screen stopped responding twice (in the middle of using it) and needed to be hard reset, so I decided to return it. I got my refund within 1-2 weeks after sending the postage out I believe. I reordered another one from these guys I got a 258 green 11 for $620 (unlocked too) which was only about 18 dollars more than what I had originally spent on the black 128 one. Anyways the new one came a few (I found 2) external flaws on the metal part of the phone, but they aren't super noticeable it didn't come with any cracks or anything just some worn out paint. Anyways the phone seems to be running great and has no problems, except for some reason it doesn't notify me when the battery is low, but for a $620 refurbished phone with 258 gb storage I think I can deal with that.

429,"I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon.

If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that, it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down.

I also like that Amazon offers a 90 day return policy in case there are any problems.,1,0.25,0.55,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won‚Äôt fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked?

750,"I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone.

UNTIL it's held at an angle. See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job.

¬†The overall appearance of the iPhone is great looks new no scratches everything looks great and the accessories came with it however when I first receive the phone I try to do is set up and clean you can get past installing a software update because it just stayed on the loading screen for more than a few hours the phone does not work I don‚Äôt even know why I waste of my money no wonder it wasnt that much, you couldn‚Äôt even get past the update screen which is ridiculous I‚Äôm returning a phone .

1106,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right?

I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones.

I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.",1,-0.16458333333333336,0.33333333333333337,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned!

1397,Don‚Äôt trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word. Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I‚Äôve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,1,0.09575757575757579,0.6375757575757576,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I‚Äôve ever spent.

The phone would display an error every time you connected using a USB cable. This was tried using multiple computers and each time it would start the transfer and then error out.

I was told I should send it back and get a replacement since it had the 90-day backing guarantee from Amazon so that's what I tried to do. The sellers told me that I couldn't be sent a replacement because of stock or something, but I could send it back in for a refund. So I did just that about three days ago, and I'm still waiting for the money to be back into my account. In the mean time, I bought another one since I figured that it was probably just a one-time fluke. Thankfully, that turned out to be the case. My new ones SIM is working and I can do everything with my service. Granted, I just got it an hour ago so I don't know if there's any other kinks I haven't figured out yet, but so far so good.

3322,"This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth i",1,0.38119834710743805,0.4984848484848485,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0

And i dont regret coz of 5G nor with LCD screen I know the screen quality is super and i can rely on apple without any fear and 5G i know in India it will at least take 3-4yrs to get 100%. So, buying iPhone 12 only for screen and 5G and pay 20k bucks isn't justified.

3583,"Meeni, 14 Oct 2021How is your experience so far? Hi all, 
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m writing this review after my usage of 4days. I bought my iPhone 11 128gb from an authorised reseller in Pune and at more premium price than Amazon sale. It costs me 50.9k after 4k cash back i.e. $690 approx. 
I was planning to buy an iPhone since many years but never got a budget to buy it. So wanted to buy my 1st iPhone self from an authorised dealer in my city. Here r my observations: 
1. Battery life is not so good in iOS 15, I need to charge my iPhone twice a day even with average usage like checking WhatsApp msgs, FB, Insta & browsing internet. No games I play. 
2. UI is very smooth which all know spclly the keyboard/typing usage. 
3. No call recording option √∞≈∏Àú¬© 
4. File manager is not easy/open to be used like Android. Over that U can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t directly connect ur iPhone to Windows PC and transfer contents betn d two. Always u have to rely on iTunes software installed on ur PC. 
5. No option to add ur own ringtones 
6. Camera is good in daylight both wide & ultrawide but details are less when compared to my 64MP camera on my Samsung M51. No night mode on Ultrawide & selfie cameras. Night mode photos with rear cam is abv average. Video is very stable due to OIS in rear camera. Better go for iPhone 12. 
7. In hand feel is good. Bit heavier than iPhone 12. 
8. Felt like using a dull screen than when compared to my Samsung M51 as iPhone 11 has HD LCD screen while even budget range Android phones r having FHD Amoled screen like M51. 
9. I switched to iOS for it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s smooth flawless experience, long term OS updates, value of iPhone do not deteriorate faster like Androids and yes cameras r good (not when compared to higher MP camera in flagship Android phones) 
10. I still feel it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a restricted OS but secure and not an open platform like Android.
 
Just an ok mobile phone. In today√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time better opt for iPhone 12 or 13√¢‚Ç¨¬¶don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go for iPhone 11 now else u will feel unhappy like me.",0,0.30049019607843136,0.5294117647058824,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0

Still amazing cpu and gpu performance even compared to higher end androids. Plus not having an OLED means the phone will last longer.

3731,Guys I have shifted from Samsung Note 8 to iPhone 12 and feeling eye strain more than that of Note 8. After watching the videos on PWM of iPhone the effect is more pronounced may be added psychological effect. So was thinking to sell out my iPhone 12 and buy iPhone 11. Did a lot of research on Internet as well but wanted to ask if someone is using both iPhone 12 & 11 side by side that whether this effect will reduce if I shift to iPhone 11 or not? Mainly this PWM flickering is more pronounced in low light conditions and since i am a heavy user rather mobile addict so feeling it more. Need advice should I switch to iPhone 11 or not ?

3805,"anju lavoch, 29 Jan 2021hi friends, need your advise. im currently an android user n planning to try ios. few friends ... moreWell of course there is a big difference!
 
Firstly, the design is newer: the iPhone 7+ has chunky bezels, but the iPhone 11 has slim bezels all around. 
 
Secondly, the materials used in the two phones are different, 
iPhone 7+ (aluminum all around) 
iPhone 11 (glass on the back, aluminum on the sides)
 
The colours are different but simmilar, 
Both phones have black, white and red options. 
But the 11 has green, purple and yellow options aswell as the standard colour set. 
And the 7+ has a 'Jet' black option (I haven't seen it in person tho)
 
The chipsets are different. 
The iPhone 7 Plus's chip (Apple A10 Fusion) is based on a 16nm process with 3GB RAM. 
But the iPhone 11's (Apple A13 Bionic) is on a more power efficient 7nm process with 4GB RAM. 
If you like gaming or want to have more apps open at the same time, go with the 11, pal.
 
The cameras are simmilar, but are different in ways. 
The two phones have dual cameras. 
They have 12MP main cameras. 
But the 7+ has a telephoto. 
And the 11 has an ultrawide. 
But both record in 4K.
 
Battery life is simmilar and not too far off.",0,-0.10128205128205128,0.317948717948718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3806,"Been using this phone for the past 4 and a half months. It's amazing, better than my old Mi Mix 2s. I really like the notch tbh, the cameras are brill and the battery is great. I've never had a glass phone before cause my old ones were ceramic and plastic, but it feels so lovely. It does heat up a bit tho not that much, it's more around the frame. It works amazingly well at being a hotspot for my PC. I don't mind the 326ppi cause it's not really that noticeable and my first touch phone, the Alcatel Pixi 4 (5-inch 2016), had 196ppi. Colours on the screen looks fab. BTW, I got my phone before the no charger/earpods. But it had that silly 5W charger in the box, so I got a Juice 18W one in Carphone Warehouse back at Halloween. It works a treat! I don't have a wireless charger though. It isn't really heavy and rather lightweight for the 194 grams. Performance is spectacular. iOS 14 is brilliant and so was iOS 13. Camera is great, but the ultrawide one is really soft indoors. Video recording is simply amazing.

The colours are accurate, brightness level is enough, truetone function is great so there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s  no problem at all when watching video or gaming on the phone. The only differences is when you compare the screen side by side which is irrelevant in the real life usage. Secondly, the performance of this phone is just beastly. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s blazing fast experience with no lag or hiccups even in 3d gaming on highest setting. Furthermore with such powerful yet efficient processor you could expect longer battery life. The third longest battery life on an iPhone actually. Only bested by its more premium brothers, the 11 pro and 11 pro max. Lastly the most praised aspect of an iPhone. The camera. Now with the 11, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s even  better. New image processor makes the image produced more vibrant and natural yet preserved the detail. The new ultrawide camera also is really fun to play around.

But from my point of view (not necessarily everyone's) I do say that the iPhone 11's screen is NOT AS BAD as the pundits might tell you.  
In terms of reliability, my previous Galaxy S10 had from time to time battery issues (random days it would drain faster than usual). Apps would freeze. And most annoying the entire UI sometimes would freeze. And only after several presses on the power button would come back. Not saying ALL S10s are like that. I'm just saying mine was like that. 
In the end, it's personal preference. I've been a ""faithfull"" Android user like 95%. Now I decided to do the switch. Have some else. Even if that something else might be considered ""limiting"".

4146,"I was so excited to FINALLY obtain an iPhone. My family is Android all the way. I had to listen to how it was too much money for a phone. I was warned but I held steadfast. I was unfamiliar with the iPhone so when I 1st got locked out of my phone. I called several times during last month and no one could assist me. Finally at the end of the month, a pleasant young man named George aided me. There was also another advisor, Trish. Finally after a month without being able to use my phone (except as a paperweight),I had access to my phone. I made a second mistake and I called to no avail. I was able to provide my CC on file along with my phone number so, the apple ID page showed 3 days before I could reset my password. Imagine my shock when I saww 22 hours left the day before and on the next day, it showed that I have 18 days before I could reset my ID password! 18 DAYS!!! And this is with CC and phone number. When I called for this I was told that they have no control over what the system comes up with. No one could not explain going from 22 hours to 18 days. I was then told that I had to show additional proof like my paperwork from buying the phone. I explained that I was paying monthly. I was sent a long address that was supposedly where I needed to send my additional proof. Problem?  There was absolutely nowhere to attach anything. I just sent it to the Apple Support email that I received with the link that served no purpose.  I am regretting like crazy making this purchase.

Honestly, the screen is not that bad. As a disclaimer: I've owned a lot of Android phones, mainly Samsung ones (Galaxy S4, S8+, Note 9, S10). This iPhone 11 is my 2nd iPhone I've owned (previous was SE).  
What can I tell after these weeks:  
- the iPhone screen while not as sharp or bright as S10's is still a nice piece of tech. The resolution is great and I honestly cannot see any individual pixels 
- the overall experience with the iPhone is that the interface is much smoother. Yes, Samsung has made great strides with it's One UI 2.1, but there's still some polish to do. Mainly animations are choppier. And the gestures while are great (FYI straight copy from iOS) still have some tweaking to do. Only if you used both you will understand what I'm talking about.  
- battery life is much better than the one on S10 - personally I used the phone mostly indoors (due to quarantine restrictions) on home wifi. With the S10 with 100% charge in the morning sometimes I end up with 40% in the evening others with 20%. Same usage with the iPhone I get around 60% in the evening. 
 
Other things like price it comes down to your own budget. I personally paid twice as much on the iPhone than what I paid for the S10 back in December.
 
Anyway, as a conclusion: don't judge the iPhone based on other people's comments about the screen. Believe me it's all bullshit. The LCD screen is nice a sharp enough for almost any media consumption.",0,0.36203703703703705,0.726851851851852,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0

I suggest u to think the preferences first.... 
First think about android or ios 
Second the longivity in terms of software updates flagship android like note 10 u will get 3 yrs update regularly every month security patches and quaterly for the 4th year....no more updates after that....major 2 OS update u will get..... 
In case of ios u will get updates upto 5 years..... 
Therefore u can enjoy andoid for 3 years and ios for 5 years 
Third make ur mind whether u need that sPen....it is very helpful for ur work if u need it...... 
As per camera both the phones capture are stunning

So tips, 
1. Do not use non mfi (make for idevices) wires and chargers, some are bad. 
2. Keep battery levels between 80 to 20 percent. Don't keep charging to 100% when you have like say 95% or let it discharge fully. 
3. Keep a habit to charge your phone regularly, for instance every night at 11pm.. etc etc, because iOS have smart battery charging, it will detect your habit and slow down the charge when it reaches 80 percent. 
4. Use fast charge as emergency only, use Apple authorised cables and charger, make sure its rated at 9V 2A (18W), and best if your battery is at 20%, and stop at 80%.",0,0.2306122448979592,0.42980987266701554,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

For all the iOS haters, you need to spend reasonable time using an iPhone to realize it's potential. You'll never understand the experience unless you've used an iPhone for considerable amount of time.
 
Having a package deal of the h/w+s/w offered from the same source is great. It's like Google pixel devices where both the hardware and software is from the same manufacturer. It warrants your device for a few years with latest OS and security upgrades. Although Google has nailed the software part with Android, I feel they still have a long way to rival iPhone's hardware. So for now, I am happy enjoying iPhone's experience :)",0,0.4125,0.6375,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
