Very sleek, the screen is pretty good for being IPS (I've been using phones with AMOLED screens since a few years now), very snappy, camera quality is great specially the videos... No need to say she's loving it. I think it was around $460 for the 64 GB version, brand new, which comes with around 48 GB for the user. I think the capacity might be an issue but it isn't terrible.

And i dont regret coz of 5G nor with LCD screen I know the screen quality is super and i can rely on apple without any fear and 5G i know in India it will at least take 3-4yrs to get 100%. So, buying iPhone 12 only for screen and 5G and pay 20k bucks isn't justified.

329,no_ID,"Meeni, 14 Oct 2021How is your experience so far? Hi all, 
Iâ€™m writing this review after my usage of 4days. I bought my iPhone 11 128gb from an authorised reseller in Pune and at more premium price than Amazon sale. It costs me 50.9k after 4k cash back i.e. $690 approx. 
I was planning to buy an iPhone since many years but never got a budget to buy it. So wanted to buy my 1st iPhone self from an authorised dealer in my city. Here r my observations: 
1. Battery life is not so good in iOS 15, I need to charge my iPhone twice a day even with average usage like checking WhatsApp msgs, FB, Insta & browsing internet. No games I play. 
2. UI is very smooth which all know spclly the keyboard/typing usage. 
3. No call recording option ðŸ˜© 
4. File manager is not easy/open to be used like Android. Over that U canâ€™t directly connect ur iPhone to Windows PC and transfer contents betn d two. Always u have to rely on iTunes software installed on ur PC. 
5. No option to add ur own ringtones 
6. Camera is good in daylight both wide & ultrawide but details are less when compared to my 64MP camera on my Samsung M51. No night mode on Ultrawide & selfie cameras. Night mode photos with rear cam is abv average. Video is very stable due to OIS in rear camera. Better go for iPhone 12. 
7. In hand feel is good. Bit heavier than iPhone 12. 
8. Felt like using a dull screen than when compared to my Samsung M51 as iPhone 11 has HD LCD screen while even budget range Android phones r having FHD Amoled screen like M51. 
9. I switched to iOS for itâ€™s smooth flawless experience, long term OS updates, value of iPhone do not deteriorate faster like Androids and yes cameras r good (not when compared to higher MP camera in flagship Android phones) 
10. I still feel itâ€™s a restricted OS but secure and not an open platform like Android.
 
Just an ok mobile phone. In todayâ€™s time better opt for iPhone 12 or 13â€¦donâ€™t go for iPhone 11 now else u will feel unhappy like me.",16-Oct-21,Oct,2021,16,1,1

331,Jordan Reed,"ddas, 11 Oct 2021I'm still wondering that if it worths buying iPhone 11 in 2021?Personally thereâ€™s nothing wrong with the base iPhone 11, the only feature it really lacks from the higher models is an OLED display and high refresh from the 13 series.

Camera and audio speakers are wonderful. For battery life, it is great as I charge it once in two days and sometimes at the end of each day. Bluetooth is turned off at all times. Battery capacity is still at 100% even in its 7th month of usage. 
 
Usage: standard telephone calls, video calls (occasional and short), text messaging, web browsing with some video viewing, checking emails (2 email accounts), checking Google maps/checking bus arrival timings and taking photos and videos. Been using the DUAL ESIM function too.

551,Anonymous,"anju lavoch, 29 Jan 2021hi friends, need your advise. im currently an android user n planning to try ios. few friends ... moreWell of course there is a big difference!
 
Firstly, the design is newer: the iPhone 7+ has chunky bezels, but the iPhone 11 has slim bezels all around. 
 
Secondly, the materials used in the two phones are different, 
iPhone 7+ (aluminum all around) 
iPhone 11 (glass on the back, aluminum on the sides)
 
The colours are different but simmilar, 
Both phones have black, white and red options. 
But the 11 has green, purple and yellow options aswell as the standard colour set. 
And the 7+ has a 'Jet' black option (I haven't seen it in person tho)
 
The chipsets are different. 
The iPhone 7 Plus's chip (Apple A10 Fusion) is based on a 16nm process with 3GB RAM. 
But the iPhone 11's (Apple A13 Bionic) is on a more power efficient 7nm process with 4GB RAM. 
If you like gaming or want to have more apps open at the same time, go with the 11, pal.
 
The cameras are simmilar, but are different in ways. 
The two phones have dual cameras. 
They have 12MP main cameras. 
But the 7+ has a telephoto. 
And the 11 has an ultrawide. 
But both record in 4K.
 
Battery life is simmilar and not too far off.",2-Feb-21,Feb,2021,2,0,0
552,Anonymous,"Been using this phone for the past 4 and a half months. It's amazing, better than my old Mi Mix 2s. I really like the notch tbh, the cameras are brill and the battery is great. I've never had a glass phone before cause my old ones were ceramic and plastic, but it feels so lovely. It does heat up a bit tho not that much, it's more around the frame. It works amazingly well at being a hotspot for my PC. I don't mind the 326ppi cause it's not really that noticeable and my first touch phone, the Alcatel Pixi 4 (5-inch 2016), had 196ppi. Colours on the screen looks fab. BTW, I got my phone before the no charger/earpods. But it had that silly 5W charger in the box, so I got a Juice 18W one in Carphone Warehouse back at Halloween. It works a treat! I don't have a wireless charger though. It isn't really heavy and rather lightweight for the 194 grams. Performance is spectacular. iOS 14 is brilliant and so was iOS 13. Camera is great, but the ultrawide one is really soft indoors. Video recording is simply amazing.

675,Me,Its not all cracked up as they said it would be. Being a first time owner of a iPhone I can say itâ€™s not worth all the money itâ€™s worth. I had all kinds of issues with the phone from the get go. From watching movies to download issues. No I donâ€™t do a lot of things just text and calls. But I do a lot of traveling so I donâ€™t know if that will have anything to do with it. But I have issues with watching movies as they are blurry and take forever to load. Your phone will go into silent mode without you doing anything and that is the engineering problem and IPhone but they choose not do to anything about it so you have to reset your phone to get rid of it. I will be getting rid of my phone as I donâ€™t want it as I not happy with it . No itâ€™s never been dropped or anything it went right into the best case from the start.,23-Oct-20,Oct,2020,23,0,0

So as per your thinking OLED display are bad and for that we can sue them(Apple/Samsung etc...) for damaging our eyes
 
No dear, it's (OLED display) not that much bad 
Obviously it's depends upon the budget category but definitely not at this much premium flagship level
 
Just think about that d*mb s holes, who wants to keep their ip12 lineup(or samsung OLED) for next 5 years, for the sake of OS upgrade and not able to purchase new phone every 2years even though technology changing + features
 
I was just informing you that Apple made you fool, even though OLED technologies were available at that time(ip 11) 
And now they are able to provide it to whole ip12 lineup 
If they can do it now, then they could have done it before
 
As a customer we shouldn't dance on their tune(whatever they are providing), rather than that they should provide us what is best as per our wants, if not everything
 
Hint: next year they will provide better screen with higher refresh rate (120 + ...) And they Will say we are innovative, Which is already present with different companies flagship/budget products",19-Oct-20,Oct,2020,19,0,0

First thing about screen, my view 20 had lcd panel with 398 ppi screen and believe me iPhone 11 screen with lesser ppi looks amazing and more crisp than view 20â€™s. Also my friend has galaxy s20 and sometimes I use that just for comparison and I never felt that iPhone screen is bad in any aspect, it is bright, sharp and you wonâ€™t notice pixels.  
Second battery life is amazing, give me one full day with 6-7 hr of SOT. You just need to be bit smart for that and if not using turn off Bluetooth, WiFi, location, delete unnecessary apps, disable Siri (if not using) for longer battery life. One bad thing is fast charger is not supplied in box.  
Third camera and built quality is awesome nothing much to say and compare with any android phone.  
Fourth using iOS is so much fun, even it doesnâ€™t provide flexibility like android and still having lots of restrictions regarding file transfer, still you will definitely like it.

Yes, on paper its screen looked dated and inferior but for me I enjoyed it so much. The colours are accurate, brightness level is enough, truetone function is great so thereâ€™s  no problem at all when watching video or gaming on the phone. The only differences is when you compare the screen side by side which is irrelevant in the real life usage. Secondly, the performance of this phone is just beastly. Itâ€™s blazing fast experience with no lag or hiccups even in 3d gaming on highest setting. Furthermore with such powerful yet efficient processor you could expect longer battery life. The third longest battery life on an iPhone actually. Only bested by its more premium brothers, the 11 pro and 11 pro max. Lastly the most praised aspect of an iPhone. The camera. Now with the 11, itâ€™s even  better. New image processor makes the image produced more vibrant and natural yet preserved the detail. The new ultrawide camera also is really fun to play around. Looking from such broad perspective will ignites your sense of idea when capturing photos. And the brilliant night mode. The new addition that wrap the 11 features with style.

My wife still rocks her Galaxy S10e. Even that smaller screen is brighter, sharper and overall more pleasing to the eye. Videos, photos and games look great. 
But from my point of view (not necessarily everyone's) I do say that the iPhone 11's screen is NOT AS BAD as the pundits might tell you.  
In terms of reliability, my previous Galaxy S10 had from time to time battery issues (random days it would drain faster than usual). Apps would freeze. And most annoying the entire UI sometimes would freeze. And only after several presses on the power button would come back. Not saying ALL S10s are like that. I'm just saying mine was like that. 
In the end, it's personal preference. I've been a ""faithfull"" Android user like 95%. Now I decided to do the switch. Have some else. Even if that something else might be considered ""limiting"". In the end: is it that bad to want simplicity over function ? :)",7-Jul-20,Jul,2020,7,0,0

I was unfamiliar with the iPhone so when I 1st got locked out of my phone. I called several times during last month and no one could assist me. Finally at the end of the month, a pleasant young man named George aided me. There was also another advisor, Trish. Finally after a month without being able to use my phone (except as a paperweight),I had access to my phone. I made a second mistake and I called to no avail. I was able to provide my CC on file along with my phone number so, the apple ID page showed 3 days before I could reset my password. Imagine my shock when I saww 22 hours left the day before and on the next day, it showed that I have 18 days before I could reset my ID password! 18 DAYS!!! And this is with CC and phone number. When I called for this I was told that they have no control over what the system comes up with. No one could not explain going from 22 hours to 18 days. I was then told that I had to show additional proof like my paperwork from buying the phone. I explained that I was paying monthly. I was sent a long address that was supposedly where I needed to send my additional proof. Problem?  There was absolutely nowhere to attach anything. I just sent it to the Apple Support email that I received with the link that served no purpose.  I am regretting like crazy making this purchase.

Honestly, the screen is not that bad. As a disclaimer: I've owned a lot of Android phones, mainly Samsung ones (Galaxy S4, S8+, Note 9, S10). This iPhone 11 is my 2nd iPhone I've owned (previous was SE).  
What can I tell after these weeks:  
- the iPhone screen while not as sharp or bright as S10's is still a nice piece of tech. The resolution is great and I honestly cannot see any individual pixels 
- the overall experience with the iPhone is that the interface is much smoother. Yes, Samsung has made great strides with it's One UI 2.1, but there's still some polish to do. Mainly animations are choppier. And the gestures while are great (FYI straight copy from iOS) still have some tweaking to do. Only if you used both you will understand what I'm talking about.  
- battery life is much better than the one on S10 - personally I used the phone mostly indoors (due to quarantine restrictions) on home wifi. With the S10 with 100% charge in the morning sometimes I end up with 40% in the evening others with 20%. Same usage with the iPhone I get around 60% in the evening. 
 
Other things like price it comes down to your own budget. I personally paid twice as much on the iPhone than what I paid for the S10 back in December.
 
Anyway, as a conclusion: don't judge the iPhone based on other people's comments about the screen. Believe me it's all bullshit. The LCD screen is nice a sharp enough for almost any media consumption.",22-May-20,May,2020,22,1,0

I suggest u to think the preferences first.... 
First think about android or ios 
Second the longivity in terms of software updates flagship android like note 10 u will get 3 yrs update regularly every month security patches and quaterly for the 4th year....no more updates after that....major 2 OS update u will get..... 
In case of ios u will get updates upto 5 years..... 
Therefore u can enjoy andoid for 3 years and ios for 5 years 
Third make ur mind whether u need that sPen....it is very helpful for ur work if u need it...... 
As per camera both the phones capture are stunning 
Battery Life most likely same in both phones....1 day use u will get easily....
 
I choose note 10 bcos i need that spen for my work purpose....but i will be missing that 5 years of update of using an iphone

No phone on the market is a definite when it comes to water and that's exactly why phone manufacturers won't cover you on device warranty. Unfortunately heavy downpour can ruin 'water resistant' phones even if they claim it can withstand 1.5 meters deep. It literally takes one drop of liquid to get through the phones defenses. In future, my advice to you and anyone reading this is if you want to be covered for a Â£1,000 plus phone (or any device that is important to you and you value) then get yourself cover one way or another, it avoids a lot of heart ache.",4-Mar-20,Mar,2020,4,0,0

LG V30 also some users experience the same. User of Nokia 8 also commented that his phone got burn-in after several months of use.
 
My Xiaomi Mi 5s IPS LCD also got burn-in after several hours playing game Silent Hills: Origin using PPSSPP. It is released 2016, it is not 10 years ago. 
 
So, I guess no guarantee even iPhone 11 series would not get burn-in (image retention) from their LCD.

So tips, 
1. Do not use non mfi (make for idevices) wires and chargers, some are bad. 
2. Keep battery levels between 80 to 20 percent. Don't keep charging to 100% when you have like say 95% or let it discharge fully. 
3. Keep a habit to charge your phone regularly, for instance every night at 11pm.. etc etc, because iOS have smart battery charging, it will detect your habit and slow down the charge when it reaches 80 percent.

Having a package deal of the h/w+s/w offered from the same source is great. It's like Google pixel devices where both the hardware and software is from the same manufacturer. It warrants your device for a few years with latest OS and security upgrades. Although Google has nailed the software part with Android, I feel they still have a long way to rival iPhone's hardware.
