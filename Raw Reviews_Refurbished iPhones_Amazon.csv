0,Jells,So far so good,Verified Purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed to replace my teens Iphone and absolutely refuse to pay the gross prices of new phones, especially for teens who tend to break or damage phones easier. I almost bought a refurbished phone from Ebay until I saw on Google that Amazon sold them. Amazon has a better return policy and I’m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they weren’t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and I’ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so can’t say much else.",27-Sep-22,September,2022,1,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0

2,wp,Works great.,Verified Purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone can’t expect perfect condition that’s why I’m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone can’t really see but since I applied a screen protector can’t see it at all 😁. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also can’t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but let’s see how that goes . I’m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and it’s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyone’s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .,27-Aug-22,August,2022,0,1,0,-1,0,0,,0,0
3,Bri,Great product,Verified Purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasn’t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.",17-Sep-22,September,2022,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0

So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had.

I wasn’t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I don’t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

7,Dov,Battery life is not the best but the phone is a great phone,Verified Purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,Apple phones are always a great phone his phones have a 90 day return policy which I think is very important for a phone the battery life though is not the best but the screen functionality is pretty well and it also has Face ID that works great and the best part about it is that on a regular phone when you run out of storage it starts going slow but Apple even when you run out of storage but even before you get to iCloud the phone does not run slow so I always love the Apple so I do recommend it so even though it’s much newer models out there told your phone still works good I just keep in mind though that not all of them the battery life is amazing which I find is a very important to mention,18-Aug-22,August,2022,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0

75,Anna,I wish this was perfect *Updated*,Verified Purchase,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would like to say this is a perfect phone, and it certainly did work perfectly… until exactly 6 months after my purchase, and I mean 6 months TO THE DAY. When it suddenly stopped working, wouldn’t charge, began turning on and off repetitively about every 2-5 minutes, and it kept saying something along the lines of “battery cannot be confirmed as an apple product”. So whatever battery is in my phone well .. idk wtf it is :|. Along with that when I brought it to Best Buy’s geek squad it was so far gone that the supervisor couldn’t really do much and since for some reason they seem to have thrown random parts together and made it somehow work for half a year, it also means that (at least at best buy through their connection with apple) they couldn’t find my phone/serial number in the system at all which meant I couldn’t even get a replacement which would’ve been fricken covered but now I have to go to apple directly and am going to have to pay for a replacement battery and gods know what else. :|Update: I finally had my appt with apple and I thought it would maybe cost $150 max to replace the battery, ended up having to spend another $450 to just get an entirely new replacement phone instead. The battery still wouldn’t charge, and they said the wireless charger was so far gone and it was messed up somehow and that was what was causing the issue. I’m very suspicious though about how it all went down because I seriously mean it when I say it stopped working exactly 6 months after I bought it to the day 😭",4-Aug-22,August,2022,1,0,1,1,0,0,,0,0

However, yesterday my phone randomly crashed and it was at 50%. I turned it on and it was completely dead, but it was on. It said 0% remaining when I plugged it in and it was not seeming to charge. I went on settings and it told me that the battery in the phone is likely not compatible with this phone or it is not an actual apple battery. Now it can't go 2 minutes without crashing. I cannot even write this review on my phone because it will crash so I am using a computer. I would return the phone, but I cannot keep it on long enough to transfer my information to a new phone or to reset it. I am very disappointed and I do not know what to do. I would recommend buying straight from apple to ensure the phones reliability. Edit: I took it into best buy and I was told that the battery is not the issue, it failed all the tests and they did not replace it. I am not sure what the problem is. Maybe I just got a defective phone with my luck. I'm sure the other phones from this seller are reliable, I just had a bad experience.

148,Kyle@Austin,Great customer svc from vendor BHHT,Verified Purchase,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: vendor BHHT adjusted price/refund on scratched unit to allow for “acceptable” condition, not “good”, & is sending missing pwr adapters, so i can def rec this vendor. ORIGINAL: Bought 2 of these (“good” category) from vendor BHHT. The downside was that neither of the power adapters were included, as advertised, and one of them fits the “acceptable“ category description, much more so than the “good“ category description (re: scratched screen). The batteries came in at 84% and 85%, just above the minimum 80% described. Otherwise, the iPhone 11 is a great phone, and very similar to the current generation models.

151,Anijah villela,It’s alright .,Verified Purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and it’s hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it’s unlocked in packaging and on here… I began the activation process … and it wouldn’t not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It’s disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can’t even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It’s just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier. But I love getting them from Amazon I got my last phone from here and had no issues but now it’s like I don’t want to even purchase phones from here anymore !

However, only one of the speakers on the bottom actually produces sound, and the earpiece is so quiet that I always have to put people on speaker during phone calls, or just use headphones. However, that isn’t so bad, the only major issue for me is the battery life, I can charge this phone all night before work and by the time I get off at 2, the battery is at 50%, and my job doesn’t allow me to have my phone on the floor so it drains that quickly just from being on standby.

I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone, but it is now over a month old and working great and I was quite pleased that it came early by Fed-X.The phone came in a nice box that had the iPhone, Apple charger, charging block, and a screen protector already installed on the phone. I transferred the Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into the new phone with no problem. I didn't need to have the phone activated and everything from my old phone transferred readily.I received everything I ordered: iPhone 11, 256 gb, red, and unlocked. The phone looks brand new, has no dents or scratches on the screen. The battery is at 89% but other than that it could be a new phone instead of a refurbished one. The cameras quality is amazing.This is a great phone for the price as I could not afford to buy it new. I am totally pleased with the service that I received and would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone to anyone needing a new phone but not able to pay the price for a new one!",24-Feb-22,February,2022,1,1,0,0,0,0,We considered the second one.,2,0

When I looked this up it said that it could be caused by the battery pressed up against the screen and could not be repaired unless we replaced the screen and it could be due to an enlarged battery.

Communication with the seller was outstanding! I initially did it via Amazon chat and then I asked for a phone number. When I called I got a voicemail and though hmm they are not going to call back. But they did, the person who I spoke with was fantastic. ATT was able to transfer my service without a problem.The morale of the story is don’t give up if it doesn’t work the 1st time.

An authentic Apple device, no scratches or cracks on the screen, perfect cosmetic condition, perfect cameras, etc etc. However there are two very notable issues I discovered not long after acquiring this phoneFirst is the bottom speaker must have been replaced with a generic one, because it's quite low quality. Not enough to ruin the phone, but noticeably poor.Second is the battery. The phone arrived with an 89% battery health. A fair health that will last me a long time, but it's not 100%, meaning they did not bother replacing it which means I'm not going to experience 17 hour battery life as advertised.

No where on the packaging does the guarantee which came in the packaging does it state that the phone must function at last at 90% of its battery capacity. At first use, the battery went to like 70 ish percent after a hour of use where we just tried to set the phone up.

Select about…then scroll till you see carrier lock… it should say (NO SIM RESTRICTIONS).. that’s how you know it’s unlocked to any carrier. If your SIM does go through but it read’s it with no service you have to go to your carrier and have them switch the SIM card on to your new phone from your old device. You’re welcome!

Clearly not an excellent condition device. It did power up and was otherwise functional, sure, hence 2 stars. I paid extra not to have to stare at a scratch every time I pick it up.

In the pictures show there were metal chips along the edges and buttons on the side and a clearly visible circle shown on the back of the phone along with the label put directly on it. I did not test the phone further because I already knew that it was unacceptable to give to my brother this phone in the condition it was in, I have requested a refund already and want to warn people of the risk that comes with ordering a renewed phone that is all I have for this review and I hope whoever reads this can make a more informed decision on their purchase.",18-Mar-22,March,2022,0,0,0,0,0,0,"There were a lot of scratches but none of them were on the camera or screen.

407,safia,easy to return,Verified Purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,"so when I got this phone the touch screen didn't seem to be working and needed a hard reset to work (hold power button and then tap volume down once then volume up once), after this the phone was good and ran smooth (also had 100% battery health and there were no external flaws on the phone) except the touch screen stopped responding twice (in the middle of using it) and needed to be hard reset, so I decided to return it. I got my refund within 1-2 weeks after sending the postage out I believe. I reordered another one from these guys I got a 258 green 11 for $620 (unlocked too) which was only about 18 dollars more than what I had originally spent on the black 128 one. Anyways the new one came a few (I found 2) external flaws on the metal part of the phone, but they aren't super noticeable it didn't come with any cracks or anything just some worn out paint. Anyways the phone seems to be running great and has no problems, except for some reason it doesn't notify me when the battery is low, but for a $620 refurbished phone with 258 gb storage I think I can deal with that. Also I was hoping to get another 100% battery health on the new one and instead got 90%, which isn't horrible but I just miss having 100%.",10-Feb-21,February,2021,0,1,0,-1,0,0,We considered the first iphone.,0,0

430,Nicolas H.,"Switch from Android flagships to this, and happily surprised.",Verified Purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.",31-Jul-20,July,2020,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0

460,Jones007,"Okay quality, a few complaints.",Verified Purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that, it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts.",1-May-20,May,2020,0,1,0,-1,1,0,,0,0

It is now January 30th as of this review. Concerning as I will have to then, presumably replace my battery within the year, probably just outside of the 3 month warranty window. I understand it’s a refurbished phone, but you would think they would at least swap the battery out with a new one or run a performance diagnostic. Everything else is mediocre-to-fine.

I took it to a phone repair place to get the screen replaced bcuz when I bought the phone and set it up, I kept havin a notification in the settings tellin me that the display wasn’t a genuine apple part. Only way to fix that was to change out the screen. When I took it to the phone repair place and they opened up the phone, the battery was completely fried and they said the speakers were all failin. I had to end up gettin a brand new iPhone 11 thru the phone repair place bcuz they explained to me that for what it was gonna cost to repair this iPhone 11 that I had bought on amazon that I might as well just buy a brand new one, so I did. So yeah don’t waste ur time on this phone. Ur betta off just buyin a brand new iPhone 11 than buyin this piece of crap.",19-Jul-22,July,2022,0,1,0,-1,0,0,,0,1

I’m a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase. The phone doesn’t come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash. With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised. It stared right up and went through start up process. My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way. I’ve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc). I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it’s supposed to be. If you’re concerned about packaging and having a “uniquely” Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store.",18-Apr-20,April,2020,1,1,0,0,1,0,,1,0

The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn’t all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won’t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I’ve read that it’s a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !",21-Sep-21,September,2021,0,1,0,-1,0,0,Disappointing means bad.

The only reason I feel disappointed is because the phone has an non-Genuine aftermarket screen, no where in the description does it say the phone has been replaced with non-Genuine apple parts. I feel disappointed because now the phone has a message saying that the display is not genuine. I felt like I was cheated and would like to request to have another one shipped out but with the genuine screen. Or at least a partial refund. So buyer BEWARE if you buy from here you could get shipped an iPhone that has non genuine aftermarket parts.

I’m a disabled person receiving ssi, and I purchased this phone to have an iPhone, and at least save some by getting refurbished because I live off ssi check. Now the phone that I received is terrible, at first the package seemed to have moisture inside of it. I don’t know why or how? But the packaging came disgusting! The phone came with a screen protector that was flimsy so I took it off to inspect came to notice it has a bunch of scratches on the screen! Let alone it took me forever to turn it on’ I didn’t know if it was because it came dead or broken, but I did manage to turn it on! So I messaged the seller for a refund, and he told me to call fedex and set up a pick up and practically deal with it myself! I don’t have a cellular with service to pick up and call fedex and I don’t do much with out my social worker, I messaged Amazon and told them the seller was leaving me in the dark and they told me to wait 5-7 days for my refund… am not satisfied at all. They have no respect for the disable. Now I bet with in 5-7 day I’ll get the same message from them telling me contact fedex or keep waiting! I hope this all gets resolved.

But its entirely like new, although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new, and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up, but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it, its absolutely beautiful.

753,Daurys Nolasco,"If purchased from CPRTX, return inmediately and pray you don't get stolen.",Verified Purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens.",8-Nov-21,November,2021,1,0,1,1,0,1,,2,0

 ** Edit **The seller provided a copy of the report showing all components were OEM, so it was simply an oversight on the Quality Control of the reseller - which is understandable, since it was only noticed upon angled inspection.*****This phone actually looked amazing - barely any scratches on the case and the screen appeared wonderful.... UNTIL it's held at an angle. See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job. And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth. Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up. Not worth $500 as a refurb.

As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it’s unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I’m digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger.

At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that’s I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren’t plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I’m afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I’ve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase...",20-Apr-21,April,2021,1,1,0,-1,0,0,,1,0

I immediately contacted amazon and the people I spoke to were extremely rude and didn’t give very much help, they were very hard to understand aswell.

899,LovesLife,Great Savings Good Value,Verified Purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again.

915,Chuy,Cheaper through boost.,Verified Purchase,3.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. It’s supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost iPhone into this phone and it wouldn’t work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o won’t have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone.,11-Sep-21,September,2021,,,,,,,,,

 While to the eye it's alright at first impression, the phone is has a lot of issues. The ""like new"" description, and the overall positive reviews of a renewed device seemed promising. However the device I received was COVERED in scratches, it hadn't even been wiped off it seems.The top volume button as well is sticky, I don't believe this device was even cleaned. In the era of COVID, that's a bit concerning. If it weren't for the hardware inside working alright this would've been a total flop.While I am glad to have an IPhone, I am not glad to have had the wrong idea from the plethora of reviews of the Renewed service. I thought I would be receiving a ""Like New"" product, not a Iphone that was just chucked out.Overall, it's a good phone. The renewed service however needs some work. At the very least cleaning should've been done.",15-Mar-22,March,2022,,,,,,,,,

I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasn’t at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldn’t come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didn’t read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it!

So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished.

I couldn’t use the keyboard at all. Using the screen in any capacity quickly became impossible. I brought my phone to a few repair shops, none of which could help, some even accusing the seller to have replaced some of the inner parts with lesser quality ones. None of the employees could even get the phone into diagnostic mode as the screen kept glitching out.

The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today.

 The overall appearance of the iPhone is great looks new no scratches everything looks great and the accessories came with it however when I first receive the phone I try to do is set up and clean you can get past installing a software update because it just stayed on the loading screen for more than a few hours the phone does not work I don’t even know why I waste of my money no wonder it wasnt that much, you couldn’t even get past the update screen which is ridiculous I’m returning a phone . I really did try to give it a chance but after the four hour and it was still on the update page I just would rather returning to get my money. I also think they do this on purpose where they sell you a phone that only works up until the update page so once it’s frozen and stuck you can’t take your passcode off then they charge you EXTRA to remove a passcode. Just A SCAM and I’m sure the one I’m sending back they are just going to resell and that person is going to do the same thing smh",30-Jun-22,June,2022,,,,,,,,,

 I couldn’t have made a wiser decision about this iPhone 11. First off, it’s almost $60 cheaper than a brand new one, which is practically a steal. Then, it arrives 3 days early, who doesn’t love that? Lastly, I have boost mobile as a phone provider, so purchasing the phone totally unlocked was the way to go, walking into the store and getting the phone activated with the plan I already have took about 10 minutes, all I needed was a SIM card to be put in, which is $10.To anyone worrying about buying this and it being a bust, fear not!

The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that.

Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I’ll give them props for that! Just got the “exchange” item. IT’S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I’d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they’ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I’d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I’m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%. The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life.

I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, i’ve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!",8-Jul-20,July,2020,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0

I informed BuySPRY about this issue and they only told me there is nothing they can do about it since it’s out of warranty.I find that quite odd seeing that BuySPRY is an e-commerce business that fixes electronics and resells them ?

1111,Anthony H,Selling the last of faulty devices,Verified Purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate!

I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones.

For starters, the screen was pretty scratched when I looked at it under light. This doesn't show up when the phone and display are on, but it definitely worried me. In addition, the packaging was pretty sloppy and just came in a plastic sleeve in a cardboard box. That being said, the max capacity of battery is actually still 100% which is why I think I will still keep the phone. Buy with caution!",12-May-21,May,2021,,,,,,,,,

The seller, BuySPRY, said ""no"" and suggested that I take it to a local repair shop. I contacted Amazon again and they granted the return.There were warning signs:1) The phone came with a few greasy finger prints.2) The battery would only charge to 80% (which is what they claimed, so OK)3) Out of the box, the phone had a hard time setting up.

1209,Sarah,Very visibly used and not worth the $100 price difference compared to a new phone,Verified Purchase,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.",26-Jul-21,July,2021,,,,,,,,,

So only able to talk on speaker or Bluetooth now. Following this, my battery began going down so quickly, the most I could use the phone navigation was 10 minutes until it would turn off.

1262,kyra d.,Just keep going...DO NOT buy a phone from these people!,Verified Purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone.

Everything Else so far has been perfect but don’t expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that’s not the point.

Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)",3-Jun-20,June,2020,1,1,0,0,0,0,,1,0

Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most.",3-Jun-20,June,2020,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0

I am not happy at all. I didn’t realize the phone had this issue until after I had put in all of my information and began downloading a software update and then everything from iCloud… wasted hours of my life I’ll never get back because they sent me a phone that doesn’t play sound properly. Sucks. I am ordering another one and I will update my review.Update: I decided to go with the iPhone 11 Pro in badass army green, because it was only $400 (however, the seller immediately upped price $40 after my purchase).

1402,S Markov,Don’t trust Tech Exchange!,Verified Purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word. Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,19-May-20,May,2020,0,0,0,-1,0,0,,0,0

1549,sl1nxy,Absolute Scam.,Verified Purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur.,12-Jul-21,July,2021,,,,,,,,,

Aside from that, whoever did it stripped the nails in the bottom of the phone so we have no way of fixing it.I contacted the seller but obviously since it’s been months they are saying WE opened the phone and it’s our fault.Just please be careful who you buy from. It’s bad enough to spend $500 on a phone that was broken.. but to then be accused of having opened it and broken it just too much.

Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system. We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since.

Prr rt onlem is now they don’t have anymore … at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite.

Yes, we are 2 werks past the refund period ... but you would certainly think this seller would try to make things right by sending a replacement (which, by the way, would be the 4th phone in a few month period).

Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I “update it” even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that it’s not even a real iPhone 11.

After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone.

I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems.

3292,Margaret L. Johnson,"First one was defective, second one is fine",not_verified,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought this about two weeks ago and it didn't work. Or at least the function for connecting to my service provider didn't work. There were so SIM card restrictions, and it wasn't a problem with my provider (SIM card worked on other phones), so it had something to do with the phone itself. I was told I should send it back and get a replacement since it had the 90-day backing guarantee from Amazon so that's what I tried to do. The sellers told me that I couldn't be sent a replacement because of stock or something, but I could send it back in for a refund. So I did just that about three days ago, and I'm still waiting for the money to be back into my account. In the mean time, I bought another one since I figured that it was probably just a one-time fluke. Thankfully, that turned out to be the case. My new ones SIM is working and I can do everything with my service. Granted, I just got it an hour ago so I don't know if there's any other kinks I haven't figured out yet, but so far so good. Will update my review if I don't get my refund money or something is wrong with the new phone.Update: Top speaker has been weird since I got it. I can’t call without putting it on loud speaker because it’s way too quiet regularly. Other than that, everything is fine.",16-Jul-22,July,2022,,,,,,,,,

3336,Liz Guzman,amazing but some complaints.,not_verified,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10.
